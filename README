Shortcut Recorder is a free ApplicationKit control for easily capturing key combinations. 
It comes with an Interface Builder palette, it is customizable and resolution-independent. 

1.1 Dependencies
================

Main logic depends solely on ApplicationKit. Current version still contains a code necessary
for global shortcut (aka symbolic hotkey) manipulations, but it is automatically stripped by
preprocessor if compiled on platform other than Mac. So, dependecy on Carbon isn't a problem.

1.2 License
===========

BSD

1.3 How can I help?
===================

Use it, submit bug reports, fork it.
